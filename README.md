# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition using Python and OpenCV
This is a project of Facial Recognition System. Source : https://github.com/techwithtim/Face-Recognition

'Requirements.txt' contains all the necessary python modules for you to get started. Open cmd in the face-rec folder and type this command

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command installs all the python modules at once.

The 'faces' folder contains all the faces that the system can recognize.

You can even add your face into it. Make sure you name the image as 'YourName.jpg'

The 'test.jpg' will be the image that you want to test or compare and identify from.

You can indeed have any similar pic of yours with the name of 'test.jpg'.

In addition to ( https://github.com/techwithtim/Face-Recognition ) I've added a gtts(Google Text-to-Speech) module that reads out the name of the test image that it identified and saves it as a '.mp3' file.
